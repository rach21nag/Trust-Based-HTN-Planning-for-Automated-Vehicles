# Trust-Based-HTN-Planning-for-Automated-Vehicles

# INTRODUCTION

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a major role in bringing about changes in our daily life by
automating processes that reduce manual efforts. Automation in the automobile sector requires
human cooperation to expand the scalability of self-driving cars. When it comes to designing
the activities of automated cars, trust is a critical issue to consider. An online survey with 50
participants is thought to be an authentic technique to determine drivers’ trust in the automated
vehicle in various situations faced on the road. Along with this, the automated vehicle’s performance
tends to have a direct influence on a driver’s reliability in it. For every virtuous action of the vehicle,
the cumulative reward is increased and negatively rewarded for actions otherwise. Using both
the parameters obtained from the survey and performance analysis of the vehicle, a dynamic trust
level is determined which changes based on situations. An intelligent planning technique such as
Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning is chosen to plan routes for the automated vehicle. The
survey results show that the participants choose to trust the automated vehicle more in situations
where they doubt their own ability to control the vehicle manually as compared to situations where
environmental conditions are poor. The outcomes of the experimental setup show the preciseness of
the Pyhop planner and its ease of use for researchers because it provides a great level of flexibility
in terms of the expression of domain knowledge.
